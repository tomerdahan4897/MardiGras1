        <p class="info">
            The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
            Celebrations are
            concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the
            start of lent in
            the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many
            days have
            several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
            Gras season. In
            the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades
            and balls (some
            of them masquerade balls).

            The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade
            schedule and route
            each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the
            Knights of Momus and
            the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and events
            (often featuring
            celebrity guests), such as the Krewe of Endymion, the Krewe of Bacchus, as well as the Zulu Social Aid &
            Pleasure Club—a
            predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most
            common throws are
            strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small
            inexpensive toys.
            Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year.

            While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades originate
            in the Uptown and
            Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of
            the French
            Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in
            the Faubourg
            Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras day. Mardi Gras day traditionally
            concludes with the
            "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.

                <h2>LaToya Cantrell</h2>
                <p>LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of
                    New
                    Orleans,
                    Louisiana since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office. Before

                    The Carnival season officially begins each year on Jan. 6 -- the Feast of the Epiphany, also called
                    Twelfth Night or
                    Kings’ Day. Traditional balls are held in the weeks leading up to the big event. <br>
                    New Orleans, with its unmatched culture and world-famous music and cuisine, is an exciting place to
                    be
                    at any time of
                    the year. We invite everyone to experience Mardi Gras at least once in their lifetime. Make your
                    plans
                    now to be a part
                    of this great tradition and see firsthand why we say, "Laissez les bon temps rouler!"<br>
